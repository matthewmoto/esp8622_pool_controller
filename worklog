BRAIN_STACK:
  * LEFT-OFF:
    - Manual reset mode needs to be enabled (maybe we should just use a pin for this?
    - !!!IMPORTANT!!!: need a current limiting resistor on the shift register output when we add the manual pump override switch
    


    - Add temp, on/off logging for the relays (with a reasonable history storage) so we can record/return/clear 
      the temp of the pool/air/roof and the amount of on-time for the relays for up to a month.
 
TODO:
  * Save/Load issue (everything seems to go back to defaults on reboot rather than loading the config...)

  * test OTA with SPIFFS stuff
