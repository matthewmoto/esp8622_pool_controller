BRAIN_STACK:
  * LEFT-OFF:
    - You left this thing in a "rougly working" state, let's hit the TODO list below
  
TODO:
  * Time Stuff:
    * add a thing where we don't trust our schedule when our NTP state isn't good (either not good or hasn't been updated in 24 hours (or some magic))
    * make a state for manually step time (don't update with ntp)
    * Create a time-of-day parser for JSON input (to deal with schedules)
    * Deal with timezones and daylight savings

  * Introduce roles for relays as well (include this in the name setting thing I guess)  
    (so we can treat solar/pump specially)

  * add target temp for solar valve (getter/setter) and integrate into the control loop for relays

  * implement OTA (both firmware and filesystem) and start using it for debugging 
  * add hooks to read analog temp sensor

  * Include modal AP vs STA operating modes for setup
