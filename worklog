BRAIN_STACK:
  * LEFT-OFF:
    - Manual reset mode needs to be enabled (maybe we should just use a pin for this?
    - !!!IMPORTANT!!!: need a current limiting resistor on the shift register output when we add the manual pump override switch


  
 
TODO:

  * Change the update interval to be higher, but leave the temperature update longer (since it requires time)
  

  * Add temp, on/off logging for the relays (with a reasonable history storage) so we can record/return/clear 
    the temp of the pool/air/roof and the amount of on-time for the relays for up to a month.
